    "A database is a collection of data that is organized in a structured way to allow efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. Databases are used to store data for various applications, such as websites, enterprise software, and mobile apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with columns and rows, and use SQL as the standard language for querying and managing data. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. SQL databases are ideal for applications that require complex queries, transactions, and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a flexible, document-based format or key-value pairs. NoSQL databases use their own query language, which may not be as powerful as SQL, but are designed for high scalability, performance, and availability. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase. NoSQL databases are ideal for applications that require high throughput and low latency, such as real-time analytics and streaming data processing."
